# ProjectX Python SDK v3.2.0 Release

## 🎉 Enhanced Type Safety Release

We're excited to announce the release of ProjectX Python SDK v3.2.0! This release represents a major milestone in our commitment to code quality and developer experience, featuring a comprehensive type system overhaul, standardized deprecation handling, and improved error tracking across the entire SDK.

### 📅 Release Date: August 17, 2025

## 🌟 Key Highlights

### 🎯 Comprehensive Type System Overhaul
- **100% Type Coverage**: Every function, method, and class now has proper type hints
- **TypedDict Definitions**: All API responses and callback data structures are fully typed
- **Protocol Interfaces**: Comprehensive Protocol definitions for all major SDK components
- **Async Pattern Types**: Proper type hints for all async/await patterns
- **Type-Safe Events**: EventBus now uses fully typed event data structures

### 📊 Enhanced Error & Memory Tracking
- **StatsTrackingMixin**: New mixin providing automatic error history and memory statistics
- **Performance Metrics**: Built-in performance metric collection across all managers
- **Memory Monitoring**: Track memory usage patterns in OrderManager, PositionManager, OrderBook, and RiskManager
- **Error History**: Configurable error history tracking with detailed context

### 📋 Standardized Deprecation System
- **Unified Approach**: New `@deprecated` and `@deprecated_class` decorators across the SDK
- **Clear Migration Paths**: Every deprecation includes version info and replacement guidance
- **Metadata Tracking**: Automatic tracking of deprecated features for easier migration
- **IDE Support**: Enhanced IDE warnings and autocomplete for deprecated features

## 📈 What's New

  - Consistent async/await usage throughout

- **Performance**:
  - Better garbage collection with weak references
  - Optimized event emission preventing handler deadlocks
  - Improved type checking performance

- **Documentation**:
  - Updated all examples for v3.2.0 compatibility
  - Reorganized examples with clear numbering (00-19)
  - Enhanced README with type safety information

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### Upgrading from v3.1.x

**Good news!** v3.2.0 maintains full backward compatibility. No code changes are required to upgrade.

However, to take advantage of the new type safety features:

1. **Update your type hints** to use the new TypedDict definitions:
```python
from project_x_py.types import OrderEventData, BarData, QuoteData

async def handle_order(event: OrderEventData) -> None:
    order_id = event["order_id"]  # Type-safe access
    # ...
```

2. **Use Protocol types** for better component typing:
```python
from project_x_py.protocols import ProjectXClientProtocol

def process_data(client: ProjectXClientProtocol) -> None:
    # Works with any client implementation
    # ...
```

3. **Handle deprecations** properly:
```python
# Old method (deprecated)
positions = await client.get_positions()  # Will show deprecation warning

# New method (recommended)
positions = await client.search_open_positions()
```

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Upgrade existing installation
pip install --upgrade project-x-py

# Or with UV (recommended)
uv add project-x-py@^3.2.0

# Fresh installation
pip install project-x-py==3.2.0
```

## 🧪 Testing

The SDK now includes comprehensive test coverage:
- **47 new tests** for type system validation
- **93% coverage** for client module (up from 30%)
- **Full Protocol compliance** testing
- **Task management** lifecycle tests

Run tests with:
```bash
uv run pytest
# Or with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=project_x_py --cov-report=html
```

## 📚 Updated Examples

All 20 example scripts have been updated for v3.2.0:

### Removed (Redundant)
- `01_basic_client_connection_v3.py` (duplicate)
- `06_multi_timeframe_strategy.py` (superseded)

### Renumbered for Clarity
- Examples now properly numbered 00-19 without duplicates
- Clear progression from basic to advanced features
- Separate section for real-time data manager examples

### Example Structure
```
00-09: Core functionality (basics, orders, positions, data)
10-19: Advanced features (events, strategies, risk management)
realtime_data_manager/: Specialized real-time examples
```

## 🚀 Performance Impact

The type system improvements have minimal runtime impact:
- **Type checking**: No runtime overhead (types are ignored at runtime)
- **Memory tracking**: < 1% overhead with valuable insights
- **Event emission**: Actually improved to prevent deadlocks
- **Overall**: Better performance through optimized patterns

## 🛡️ Breaking Changes

**None!** This release maintains full backward compatibility with v3.1.x.

## ⚠️ Deprecations

The following features are deprecated and will be removed in v4.0.0:
- `client.get_positions()` → Use `client.search_open_positions()`
- `OrderTracker` class → Use `TradingSuite.track_order()`
- Legacy callback methods → Use EventBus handlers

All deprecations include clear migration paths and will be supported until v4.0.0.

## 🔮 What's Next

### v3.3.0 (Planned)
- WebSocket connection improvements
- Enhanced backtesting capabilities
- Additional technical indicators

### v4.0.0 (Future)
- Removal of deprecated features
- Potential API improvements based on user feedback
- Performance optimizations
