# Async OrderBook Remaining Issues

## Summary of Fixed Issues âœ…
1. **get_liquidity_levels** - Now returns lists instead of DataFrames
2. **get_order_type_statistics** - Made non-async 
3. **get_recent_trades** - Returns properly formatted list
4. **get_price_level_history** - Added method with correct signature
5. **Timezone comparisons** - Fixed in cumulative_delta, trade_flow_summary, and volume_profile

## Remaining Issues to Fix ðŸ”§

### 1. Iceberg Detection Not Working
**Issue**: Always returns "No potential iceberg orders detected"
**Root Cause**: The async version uses a simplified algorithm compared to sync version
**Sync Version Features**:
- Builds DataFrame from price level history for statistical analysis
- Uses groupby operations for aggregation
- Calculates sophisticated confidence scores
- Cross-references with trade data
- Has configurable parameters for min_total_volume, statistical_confidence

**Solution**: Port the sync version's advanced detection logic

### 2. Order Clusters Detection Too Sensitive
**Issue**: Finding 66 clusters (33 bid, 33 ask) which seems excessive
**Root Cause**: The clustering algorithm is too simple - it just groups prices within tolerance
**Sync Version Features**:
- Uses price level history for clustering
- Calculates cluster strength based on persistence and volume
- Enhances clusters with current orderbook data
- Has better tolerance calculation (3x tick size)

**Solution**: Implement more sophisticated clustering that considers volume and persistence

### 3. Volume Profile Shows Zero POC
**Issue**: Point of Control (POC) shows $0.00 despite having trades
**Possible Cause**: The bucketing logic might not be working correctly
**Solution**: Debug the price bucketing algorithm

### 4. Missing Cross-References
The sync version has several helper methods that the async version lacks:
- `_cross_reference_with_trades`
- `_find_clusters_from_history`
- `_enhance_clusters_with_current_data`

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1**: Fix iceberg detection by porting the sync version's algorithm
2. **Priority 2**: Improve cluster detection to reduce false positives
3. **Priority 3**: Fix volume profile POC calculation
4. **Priority 4**: Consider implementing the sync version's `get_liquidity_levels` which analyzes persistent liquidity using price level history

The async version needs to match the sync version's sophisticated market microstructure analysis capabilities for production use.
