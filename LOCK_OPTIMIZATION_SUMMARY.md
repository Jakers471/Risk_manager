## Implementation Highlights

### Smart Fallback Strategy
```python
# Automatically detects and uses optimized locks when available
if hasattr(self, 'data_rw_lock'):
    async with self.data_rw_lock.read_lock():
        # Optimized parallel read access
        return process_dataframe_read()
else:
    # Falls back to regular lock for compatibility
    async with self.data_lock:
        return process_dataframe_read()
```

### Integration Pattern
```python
class RealtimeDataManager(
    DataProcessingMixin,
    # ... other mixins ...
    LockOptimizationMixin,  # Added for lock optimization
):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        # Initialize optimization first
        LockOptimizationMixin.__init__(self)
        
        # Replace single lock with read/write lock
        self.data_rw_lock = AsyncRWLock(f"data_manager_{instrument}")
        self.data_lock = self.data_rw_lock  # Backward compatibility
        
        # Add lock-free buffer for high-frequency data
        self.tick_buffer = LockFreeBuffer[dict](max_size=10000)
```

### Monitoring Integration
```python
# Get detailed lock performance statistics
stats = await manager.get_lock_optimization_stats()
print(f"Average wait time: {stats['data_rw_lock']['avg_wait_time_ms']:.2f}ms")
print(f"Concurrent readers: {stats['data_rw_lock']['max_concurrent_readers']}")
print(f"Buffer operations/sec: {stats['tick_buffer']['operations_per_second']}")
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic AsyncRWLock Usage
```python
from project_x_py.utils.lock_optimization import AsyncRWLock

rw_lock = AsyncRWLock("dataframe_access")

# Multiple readers can access concurrently
async with rw_lock.read_lock():
    data = dataframe.select(pl.col("close")).tail(100)

# Writers get exclusive access
async with rw_lock.write_lock():  
    dataframe = dataframe.with_columns(new_column=pl.lit(0))
```

### Lock-Free Buffer Usage
```python
from project_x_py.utils.lock_optimization import LockFreeBuffer

# High-frequency tick data buffer
buffer = LockFreeBuffer[dict](max_size=10000)

# Atomic append (no locking)
success = buffer.append({"price": 4500.25, "volume": 100})

# Atomic read (no locking)
recent_ticks = buffer.get_recent(100)
```

### Performance Benchmarking
```python
from project_x_py.utils.lock_benchmarker import run_full_benchmark_suite

# Run comprehensive performance comparison
results = await run_full_benchmark_suite()
print(f"Throughput improvement: {results['summary']['throughput_improvement']:.2f}x")
print(f"Contention reduction: {results['summary']['contention_reduction']:.1f}%")
```
