# Technical Indicators Guide

This guide covers the comprehensive technical indicators library in ProjectX Python SDK v3.3.4+. The indicators library provides 58+ technical analysis functions built on Polars DataFrames for high-performance financial analysis.

## Overview

ProjectX includes a complete technical analysis library similar to TA-Lib, optimized for modern Python with Polars DataFrames. All indicators are designed for both real-time analysis and backtesting with vectorized operations for maximum performance.

### Key Features

- **58+ Technical Indicators**: Complete coverage of momentum, overlap, volatility, and volume indicators
- **Pattern Recognition**: Advanced patterns including Fair Value Gaps, Order Blocks, and Waddah Attar Explosion
- **Dual Interface**: Both class-based and function-based APIs
- **Polars Integration**: High-performance DataFrame operations with method chaining
- **TA-Lib Compatibility**: Familiar naming and parameter conventions
- **Real-time Updates**: Seamless integration with streaming data
- **Caching and Validation**: Built-in performance optimizations

## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
import polars as pl
from project_x_py import TradingSuite
from project_x_py.indicators import RSI, SMA, MACD

async def basic_indicators():
    # Get market data
    suite = await TradingSuite.create("MNQ")
    data = await suite.data.get_data("5min", bars=100)

    # Method chaining with pipe (recommended)
    analyzed_data = (data
        .pipe(SMA, period=20)        # Simple Moving Average
        .pipe(RSI, period=14)        # Relative Strength Index
        .pipe(MACD)                  # MACD with default parameters
    )

    # Check the results
    latest_values = analyzed_data.tail(1)
    print(f"Latest SMA(20): {latest_values['sma_20'][0]:.2f}")
    print(f"Latest RSI(14): {latest_values['rsi_14'][0]:.2f}")
    print(f"Latest MACD: {latest_values['macd'][0]:.4f}")
```

### Available Indicator Categories

The indicators are organized into logical categories:

```python
from project_x_py.indicators import (
    # Overlap Studies (Trend Following)
    SMA, EMA, DEMA, TEMA, WMA, BBANDS, SAR, MIDPOINT,

    # Momentum Indicators
    RSI, MACD, STOCH, CCI, ADX, AROON, PPO, ROC, WILLR,

    # Volatility Indicators
    ATR, NATR, TRANGE, STDDEV,

    # Volume Indicators
    OBV, VWAP, AD, ADOSC, MFI,

    # Pattern Recognition (Advanced)
    FVG,        # Fair Value Gap
    ORDERBLOCK, # Order Block Detection
    WAE,        # Waddah Attar Explosion
)
```

## Overlap Studies (Trend Following)

Overlap studies are typically plotted on the same scale as price data and help identify trend direction and support/resistance levels.

### Moving Averages

```python
async def moving_averages():
    suite = await TradingSuite.create("MNQ")
    data = await suite.data.get_data("15min", bars=200)

    # Simple Moving Average
    data_with_sma = data.pipe(SMA, period=20)

    # Exponential Moving Average (more responsive)
    data_with_ema = data.pipe(EMA, period=20)

    # Double Exponential Moving Average (even more responsive)
    data_with_dema = data.pipe(DEMA, period=20)

    # Triple Exponential Moving Average
    data_with_tema = data.pipe(TEMA, period=20)

    # Weighted Moving Average
    data_with_wma = data.pipe(WMA, period=20)

    # Combine multiple moving averages
    ma_data = (data
        .pipe(SMA, period=10)   # Fast MA
        .pipe(SMA, period=20)   # Medium MA
        .pipe(SMA, period=50)   # Slow MA
        .pipe(EMA, period=20)   # EMA for comparison
    )

    # Moving average crossover analysis
    latest = ma_data.tail(5)

    fast_ma = latest['sma_10'][-1]
    slow_ma = latest['sma_20'][-1]

    if fast_ma > slow_ma:
