# Order Management Guide

This guide covers comprehensive order management using ProjectX Python SDK v3.3.4+. All order operations are fully asynchronous and provide real-time tracking capabilities.

## Overview

The OrderManager provides complete lifecycle management for all order types including market, limit, stop, OCO (One Cancels Other), and bracket orders. All operations are async-first for optimal performance in trading applications.

### Key Features

- **Multiple Order Types**: Market, limit, stop, OCO, and bracket orders
- **Real-time Tracking**: Live order status updates via WebSocket
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry logic and comprehensive error handling
- **Price Precision**: Automatic tick size alignment using Decimal arithmetic
- **Concurrent Operations**: Place and manage multiple orders simultaneously
- **Risk Integration**: Built-in integration with RiskManager when enabled

## Getting Started

### Basic Setup

```python
import asyncio
from decimal import Decimal
from project_x_py import TradingSuite

async def main():
    # Initialize with order management capabilities
    suite = await TradingSuite.create("MNQ")

    # Order manager is automatically available
    order_manager = suite.orders

    # Get instrument information for proper pricing
    instrument = await suite.client.get_instrument("MNQ")
    print(f"Tick size: ${instrument.tickSize}")
```
