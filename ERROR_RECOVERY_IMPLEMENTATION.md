# Major Error Recovery Implementation for OrderManager

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive error recovery solution implemented to fix major issues in the OrderManager module where partial failures would leave the system in an inconsistent state.

## Problem Statement

The original OrderManager had several critical issues:

1. **Bracket Orders**: When protective orders failed after entry fills, the system had no recovery mechanism
2. **OCO Linking**: Failures during OCO setup could leave orphaned orders
3. **Position Orders**: Partial failures in complex operations had no rollback capabilities
4. **State Consistency**: No transaction-like semantics for multi-step operations
5. **Error Tracking**: Limited visibility into failure modes and recovery attempts

## Solution Architecture

### 1. OperationRecoveryManager (`error_recovery.py`)

A comprehensive recovery management system that provides:

- **Transaction-like semantics** for complex operations
- **State tracking** throughout operation lifecycle
- **Automatic rollback** on partial failures
- **Retry mechanisms** with exponential backoff and circuit breakers
- **Comprehensive logging** of all recovery attempts

#### Key Components:

```python
class OperationType(Enum):
    BRACKET_ORDER = "bracket_order"
    OCO_PAIR = "oco_pair"
    POSITION_CLOSE = "position_close"
    BULK_CANCEL = "bulk_cancel"
    ORDER_MODIFICATION = "order_modification"

class OperationState(Enum):
    PENDING = "pending"
    IN_PROGRESS = "in_progress"
    PARTIALLY_COMPLETED = "partially_completed"
    COMPLETED = "completed"
    FAILED = "failed"
    ROLLING_BACK = "rolling_back"
    ROLLED_BACK = "rolled_back"
```

#### Recovery Workflow:

1. **Start Operation**: Create recovery tracking
2. **Add Order References**: Track each order in the operation
3. **Record Success/Failure**: Track outcomes in real-time
4. **Add Relationships**: OCO pairs, position tracking
5. **Complete Operation**: Establish relationships or trigger recovery
6. **Rollback on Failure**: Cancel orders and clean up state

### 2. Enhanced Bracket Orders (`bracket_orders.py`)

Complete rewrite of the bracket order implementation with:

#### Transaction-like Semantics:
- **Step 1**: Place entry order with recovery tracking
- **Step 2**: Wait for fill with partial fill handling
- **Step 3**: Place protective orders with rollback capability
- **Step 4**: Complete operation or trigger recovery

#### Recovery Features:
```python
# Initialize recovery tracking
recovery_manager = self._get_recovery_manager()
operation = await recovery_manager.start_operation(
    OperationType.BRACKET_ORDER,
    max_retries=3,
    retry_delay=1.0
)

# Track each order
entry_ref = await recovery_manager.add_order_to_operation(...)
stop_ref = await recovery_manager.add_order_to_operation(...)
target_ref = await recovery_manager.add_order_to_operation(...)

# Attempt completion with automatic recovery
operation_completed = await recovery_manager.complete_operation(operation)
```

#### Emergency Safeguards:
- **Position Closure**: If protective orders fail completely, attempt emergency position closure
- **Complete Rollback**: Cancel all successfully placed orders if recovery fails
- **State Cleanup**: Remove all tracking relationships

### 3. Enhanced OCO Linking (`tracking.py`)

Improved OCO management with:

#### Safe Linking:
```python
def _link_oco_orders(self, order1_id: int, order2_id: int) -> None:
    """Links two orders for OCO cancellation with enhanced reliability."""
    try:
        # Validate order IDs
        if not isinstance(order1_id, int) or not isinstance(order2_id, int):
            raise ValueError(f"Order IDs must be integers: {order1_id}, {order2_id}")
        
        # Check for existing links and clean up
        existing_link_1 = self.oco_groups.get(order1_id)
        if existing_link_1 is not None and existing_link_1 != order2_id:
            logger.warning(f"Breaking existing link for order {order1_id}")
            if existing_link_1 in self.oco_groups:
                del self.oco_groups[existing_link_1]
        
        # Create bidirectional link
        self.oco_groups[order1_id] = order2_id
        self.oco_groups[order2_id] = order1_id
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to link OCO orders: {e}")
        # Clean up partial state
        self.oco_groups.pop(order1_id, None)
        self.oco_groups.pop(order2_id, None)
        raise
```

#### Safe Unlinking:
```python
def _unlink_oco_orders(self, order_id: int) -> int | None:
    """Safely unlink OCO orders and return the linked order ID."""
    try:
        linked_order_id = self.oco_groups.get(order_id)
        if linked_order_id is not None:
            # Remove both sides of the link
            self.oco_groups.pop(order_id, None)
            self.oco_groups.pop(linked_order_id, None)
            return linked_order_id
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error unlinking OCO order {order_id}: {e}")
        self.oco_groups.pop(order_id, None)
        return None
```

### 4. Enhanced Position Orders (`position_orders.py`)

Better error handling for position order operations:

#### Enhanced Cancellation:
```python
async def cancel_position_orders(self, contract_id: str, ...) -> dict[str, int]:
    results = {"entry": 0, "stop": 0, "target": 0, "failed": 0, "errors": []}
    failed_cancellations = []

    for order_type in order_types:
        for order_id in position_orders[order_key][:]:
            try:
                success = await self.cancel_order(order_id, account_id)
                if success:
                    results[order_type] += 1
                    self.untrack_order(order_id)
                else:
                    results["failed"] += 1
                    failed_cancellations.append({
                        "order_id": order_id,
                        "reason": "Cancellation returned False"
                    })
            except Exception as e:
                results["failed"] += 1
                results["errors"].append(str(e))
```

### 5. Integration with OrderManager Core

The OrderManager now includes:

#### Recovery Manager Access:
```python
def _get_recovery_manager(self) -> OperationRecoveryManager:
    """Get the recovery manager instance for complex operations."""
    return self._recovery_manager

async def get_operation_status(self, operation_id: str) -> dict[str, Any] | None:
    """Get status of a recovery operation."""
    return self._recovery_manager.get_operation_status(operation_id)

async def force_rollback_operation(self, operation_id: str) -> bool:
    """Force rollback of an active operation."""
    return await self._recovery_manager.force_rollback_operation(operation_id)
```

#### Enhanced Cleanup:
```python
async def cleanup(self) -> None:
    """Clean up resources and connections."""
    # Clean up recovery manager operations
    try:
        stale_count = await self.cleanup_stale_operations(max_age_hours=0.1)
        if stale_count > 0:
            self.logger.info(f"Cleaned up {stale_count} stale recovery operations")
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Error cleaning up recovery operations: {e}")
```
