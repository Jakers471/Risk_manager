# Release v3.1.8 - Real-time Data Reliability Improvements

## 🎯 Overview
This release addresses critical issues with real-time data processing for futures contracts, particularly improving support for E-mini futures (NQ, ES) and ensuring consistent bar generation during low-volume trading periods.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Fixed Symbol Resolution for E-mini Futures
- **Issue**: E-mini futures like NQ (which resolves to ENQ) and ES (which resolves to EP) were not receiving real-time updates
- **Root Cause**: Symbol matching logic only checked the original instrument name, not the resolved symbol ID
- **Solution**: Enhanced symbol validation to check both the user-specified instrument and the resolved symbol ID
- **Impact**: All futures contracts now work correctly with real-time data feeds

### Fixed Bar Generation During Low-Volume Periods
- **Issue**: OHLCV bars were only created when new ticks arrived, causing gaps during low-volume periods
- **Root Cause**: No periodic bar creation mechanism for quiet market periods
- **Solution**: Implemented a bar timer task that creates empty bars at proper intervals even without trading activity
- **Impact**: Consistent bar generation across all timeframes regardless of trading volume

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added robust error handling for bar time calculations
- Improved error recovery in bar timer loop to prevent task termination
- Better logging for debugging symbol resolution issues

### Code Quality Improvements
- Fixed asyncio task warnings by properly storing task references
- Improved unit conversion clarity with explicit mapping dictionary
- Optimized DataFrame operations for better performance

## 📊 Affected Components
- `RealtimeDataManager` - Core real-time data processing
- Symbol validation and matching logic
- Bar creation and timing mechanisms
- Event emission system

## 🚀 Migration Guide
No breaking changes. This version is fully backward compatible with v3.1.x.

Simply update to v3.1.8 to benefit from improved real-time data reliability:
```bash
pip install --upgrade project-x-py==3.1.8
```

## 📝 Example Usage
```python
from project_x_py import TradingSuite

# Works with all futures contracts now
suite = await TradingSuite.create(
    instrument="NQ",  # E-mini Nasdaq now works correctly
    timeframes=["1min", "5min"],
    initial_days=1
)

# Bars will be created consistently even during low-volume periods
# No gaps in your data during quiet market times
```

## 🎉 Benefits
- **Improved Reliability**: All futures contracts now receive real-time updates correctly
- **Consistent Data**: No more gaps in bar data during low-volume periods
- **Better Trading**: More reliable data for trading strategies, especially for E-mini futures
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Drop-in replacement for v3.1.7
