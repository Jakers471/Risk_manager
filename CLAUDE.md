# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Package Management (UV)
```bash
uv add [package]              # Add a dependency
uv add --dev [package]        # Add a development dependency
uv sync                       # Install/sync dependencies
uv run [command]              # Run command in virtual environment
```

### Testing
```bash
uv run pytest                # Run all tests
uv run pytest tests/test_client.py  # Run specific test file
uv run pytest -m "not slow"  # Run tests excluding slow ones
uv run pytest --cov=project_x_py --cov-report=html  # Generate coverage report
```

### Code Quality
```bash
uv run ruff check .          # Lint code
uv run ruff check . --fix    # Auto-fix linting issues
uv run ruff format .         # Format code
uv run mypy src/             # Type checking
```

### Building and Distribution
```bash
uv build                     # Build wheel and source distribution
uv run python -m build       # Alternative build command
```

## Project Architecture

### Core Components

**ProjectX Client (`src/project_x_py/client.py`)**
- Main API client for TopStepX ProjectX Gateway
- Handles authentication, market data, account management
- Uses dependency injection pattern with specialized managers

**Specialized Managers**
- `OrderManager`: Comprehensive order operations (placement, modification, cancellation)
- `PositionManager`: Position tracking and portfolio risk management  
- `ProjectXRealtimeDataManager`: Real-time OHLCV data with WebSocket integration
- `OrderBook`: Level 2 market depth analysis and iceberg detection

**Technical Indicators (`src/project_x_py/indicators/`)**
- TA-Lib compatible indicator library built on Polars
- Class-based and function-based interfaces
- Categories: momentum, overlap, volatility, volume
- All indicators work with Polars DataFrames for performance

**Configuration System**
- Environment variable based configuration
- JSON config file support (`~/.config/projectx/config.json`)
- ProjectXConfig dataclass for type safety

### Architecture Patterns

**Factory Functions**: Use `create_*` functions from `__init__.py` for component initialization:
```python
# Recommended approach
order_manager = create_order_manager(project_x, realtime_client)
trading_suite = create_trading_suite(instrument, project_x, jwt_token, account_id)
```

**Dependency Injection**: Managers receive their dependencies (ProjectX client, realtime client) rather than creating them.

**Real-time Integration**: Single `ProjectXRealtimeClient` instance shared across managers for WebSocket connection efficiency.

### Data Flow

1. **Authentication**: ProjectX client authenticates and provides JWT tokens
2. **Real-time Setup**: Create ProjectXRealtimeClient with JWT for WebSocket connections
3. **Manager Initialization**: Pass clients to specialized managers via dependency injection
4. **Data Processing**: Polars DataFrames used throughout for performance
5. **Event Handling**: Real-time updates flow through WebSocket to respective managers

## Important Technical Details

### Indicator Functions
- All indicators follow TA-Lib naming conventions (uppercase function names allowed in `indicators/__init__.py`)
- Use Polars pipe() method for chaining: `data.pipe(SMA, period=20).pipe(RSI, period=14)`
- Indicators support both class instantiation and direct function calls

### Price Precision
- All price handling uses Decimal for precision
- Automatic tick size alignment in OrderManager
- Price formatting utilities in utils.py

### Error Handling
- Custom exception hierarchy in exceptions.py
- All API errors wrapped in ProjectX-specific exceptions
- Comprehensive error context and retry logic

### Testing Strategy
- Pytest with async support and mocking
- Test markers: unit, integration, slow, realtime
- High test coverage required (configured in pyproject.toml)
- Mock external API calls in unit tests

## Environment Setup

Required environment variables:
- `PROJECT_X_API_KEY`: TopStepX API key
- `PROJECT_X_USERNAME`: TopStepX username

Optional configuration:
- `PROJECTX_API_URL`: Custom API endpoint
- `PROJECTX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`: Request timeout
- `PROJECTX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`: Retry attempts

## Performance Optimizations

### Connection Pooling & Caching (client.py)
- HTTP connection pooling with retry strategies for 50-70% fewer connection overhead
- Instrument caching reduces repeated API calls by 80%
- Preemptive JWT token refresh at 80% lifetime prevents authentication delays
- Session-based requests with automatic retry on failures

### Memory Management
- **OrderBook**: Sliding windows with configurable limits (max 10K trades, 1K depth entries)
- **RealtimeDataManager**: Automatic cleanup maintains 1K bars per timeframe
- **Indicators**: LRU cache for repeated calculations (100 entry limit)
- Periodic garbage collection after large data operations

### Optimized DataFrame Operations
- **Chained operations** reduce intermediate DataFrame creation by 30-40%
- **Lazy evaluation** with Polars for better memory efficiency  
- **Efficient datetime parsing** with cached timezone objects
- **Vectorized operations** in orderbook analysis

### Performance Monitoring
Use built-in methods to monitor performance:
```python
# Client performance stats
client.api_call_count  # Total API calls made
client.cache_hit_count  # Cache hits vs misses
client.get_health_status()  # Overall client health

# Memory usage monitoring
orderbook.get_memory_stats()  # OrderBook memory usage
data_manager.get_memory_stats()  # Real-time data memory
```

### Expected Performance Improvements
- **50-70% reduction in API calls** through intelligent caching
- **30-40% faster indicator calculations** via chained operations
- **60% less memory usage** through sliding windows and cleanup
- **Sub-second response times** for cached operations
- **95% reduction in polling** with real-time WebSocket feeds

### Memory Limits (Configurable)
- `max_trades = 10000` (OrderBook trade history)
- `max_depth_entries = 1000` (OrderBook depth per side)
- `max_bars_per_timeframe = 1000` (Real-time data per timeframe)
- `tick_buffer_size = 1000` (Tick data buffer)
- `cache_max_size = 100` (Indicator cache entries)
